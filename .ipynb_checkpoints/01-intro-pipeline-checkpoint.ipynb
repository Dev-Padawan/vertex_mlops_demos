    "#### Why are ML pipelines useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, let's first understand why you would want to use a pipeline. Imagine you're building out a ML workflow that includes processing data, training a model, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and model deployment. Each of these steps may have different dependencies, which may become unwieldy if you treat the entire workflow as a monolith. As you begin to scale your ML process, you might want to share your ML workflow with others on your team so they can run it and contribute code. Without a reliable, reproducible process, this can become difficult. With pipelines, each step in your ML process is its own container. This lets you develop steps independently and track the input and output from each step in a reproducible way. You can also schedule or trigger runs of your pipeline based on other events in your Cloud environment, like kicking off a pipeline run when new training data is available."

    "- First, just as in our previous pipeline, we define the input parameters this pipeline takes. We need to set these manually since they don't depend on the output of other steps in the pipeline.\n",
    "- The rest of the pipeline uses a few pre-built components for interacting with Vertex AI services:\n",
    "> - `TabularDatasetCreateOp` creates a tabular dataset in Vertex AI given a dataset source either in Cloud Storage or BigQuery. In this pipeline, we're passing the data via a BigQuery table URL\n",
    "> - `AutoMLTabularTrainingJobRunOp` kicks off an AutoML training job for a tabular dataset. We pass a few configuration parameters to this component, including the model type (in this case, classification), some data on the columns, how long we'd like to run training for, and a pointer to the dataset. Notice that to pass in the dataset to this component, we're providing the output of the _previous component_ via `dataset_create_op.outputs[\"dataset\"]`\n",
    "> - `EndpointCreateOp` creates an endpoint in Vertex AI. The endpoint created from this step will be passed as input to the next component\n",
    "> - `ModelDeployOp` deploys a given model to an endpoint in Vertex AI. In this case, we're using the endpoint created from the previous step. There are additional configuration options available, but here we're providing the endpoint machine type and model we'd like to deploy. We're passing in the model by accessing the outputs of the training step in our pipeline\n",
    "- This pipeline also makes use of conditional logic, a feature of Vertex Pipelines that lets you define a condition, along with different branches based on the result of that condition. Remember that when we defined our pipeline we passed a `thresholds_dict_str` parameter. This is the accuracy threshold we're using to determine whether to deploy our model to an endpoint. To implement this, we make use of the `Condition` class from the KFP SDK. The condition we pass in is the output of the custom eval component we defined earlier. If this condition is true, the pipeline will continue to execute the `deploy_op` component. If accuracy doesn't meet our predefined threshold, the pipeline will stop here and won't deploy a model."
